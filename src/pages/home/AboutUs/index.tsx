                Lisa has been passionate about beauty products & industry since
                she was a high school student. She was first introduced to
                stick-on false lashes when she was a university student. To her
                astonishment, she was amazed by how lashes can dramatically
                elevate a person's attractiveness. Ever since then she started
                getting lash extension services but none of the lash studios is
                up to standards- be it hygiene, products used and lash
                retention.

                This has inspired her to create SundayBeauty, aiming to provide
                the best possible service in the market.
